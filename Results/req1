*   **Usability**: The application will be easy to navigate and use, with clear instructions and feedback mechanisms.
*   **Performance**: The application will respond quickly to user interactions and load data efficiently.

**Technical Requirements**
-------------------------

### Infrastructure

*   **Web Server**: A web server (e.g., Apache) will host the application.
*   **Database**: A relational database management system (e.g., MySQL) will store user and product information.

### Development Tools

*   **Programming Language**: The application will be developed using a modern programming language (e.g., Java, Python).
*   **Frameworks and Libraries**: The application will utilize frameworks and libraries (e.g., Spring Boot, React) for efficient development.
*   **Version Control System**: A version control system (e.g., Git) will be used to manage code changes.

### Testing

*   **Unit Tests**: Unit tests will be written to ensure individual components of the application function as expected.
*   **Integration Tests**: Integration tests will verify that different components work together seamlessly.
*   **UI/UX Testing**: UI/UX testing will be performed to guarantee a smooth user experience.

**Assumptions and Dependencies**
---------------------------------

*   The application will integrate with an external payment gateway for secure transactions.
*   The application will adhere to the latest security standards (e.g., HTTPS, SSL/TLS) for data protection.
*   The application will follow best practices for coding conventions, naming conventions, and documentation.
